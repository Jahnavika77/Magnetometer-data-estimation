# Magnetometer-data-estimation

Magnetometer data estimation involves analyzing magnetic field measurements collected by magnetometers. 
These devices are vital across numerous fields, including geophysics, navigation, and aerospace engineering.
By capturing data on magnetic field strength and sometimes direction, magnetometers provide insights into Earth's magnetic field behavior.

## Models and parameters: 

1. Gaussian
2. Gamma
3. Inverse Gamma
4. Exponential
5. Rayleigh

## Methods to be implemented for Estimation:

1. Maximum likelihood
2. Method of moments

## Method of Simulation:
1. Firstly to our dataset, we apply different distribution models.
2. We find the best fit with the KL divergence score.
3. The GAUSSIAN model has given the lowest KL divergence score for most datasets.
4. For  a single dataset, we find out the best estimator between MLE and MOM using BOXâ€“PLOT.
5. MLE was a better estimator than MOM for both the parameters (mean and variance).
5. For all the remaining datasets, we estimate the parameters by using MLE.
